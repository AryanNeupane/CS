##  Post-Conditions

- User experience is **inconsistent** due to broken links, missing SSL, and incomplete UI sections.  
- Navigation is **partially functional**, but some forms and buttons need debugging and working file links.  
- Website lacks proper finishing and professional polish required for a public institutional site.

##  Recommendations

1. **Install a valid SSL certificate** (via *Let’s Encrypt* or *Cloudflare*) to secure the site.  
2. **Replace placeholder content** (“Lorem ipsum”) with real testimonials and text.  
3. **Fix broken “Download” links** for the Registration and Admission forms.  
4. **Improve navigation routing** — ensure all menu buttons open valid and active pages.  
5. **Optimize page loading speed** by compressing images and removing unused scripts.  
6. **Complete footer links** — include Quick Links, contact info, and social media icons.  
7. **Perform a responsive design check** on all devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).  
8. **Regularly audit website content** to maintain consistency, accessibility, and reliability.
